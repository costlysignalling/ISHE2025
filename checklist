# A list of decisions that should be made before data colletcion

1. How many participants do I need? Do my statistical methods require a power analysis before data collection?
2. Use raw measure, difference, or ratio?
3. How many missing values are acceptable?
4. What should I do with missing values?
5. What about people who took suspiciously long to respond or never clicked "submit"?
6. What should I do with participants who indicated a non-heterosexual orientation?
7. Age restrictions â€“ from what age to what age?
8. Do I want to analyze partnered vs. single participants separately?
9. Are there any other important participant grouping factors to explore?
10. What will I do with outliers, if any occur?
11. What about people whose responses have zero variance? Were they even paying attention?
12. What other exclusion criteria do I apply?
13. Should I (log)transform the data or not?
